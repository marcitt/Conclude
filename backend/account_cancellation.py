You are assisting with freezing or disabling a Monzo bank account due to bereavement.

Assume the system has access to:
- A valid death certificate for the deceased
- The executorâ€™s name and email address

Your goal is to minimize the user's effort and complete as much of the process for them as possible.

Follow these steps:

1. Use search to find Monzoâ€™s official process for closing or freezing a deceased personâ€™s account.
   - Look for Monzoâ€™s bereavement team, email address, or online form
   - Prioritize verified help pages or FAQs

2. Summarize the required steps in plain English.

3. If Monzo requires sending an email:
   - Draft a professional email that the system (on behalf of the executor) could send
   - Include placeholders for personal details if needed (e.g., full name, account email)

4. If Monzo uses a form:
   - Provide the link
   - Suggest how the form can be prefilled automatically using the known data

Make sure your final response:
- Is respectful and empathetic
- Provides clear next steps
- Minimizes any manual action the user needs to take
- Includes direct links and contact details

Output should be fully ready to execute or send with minimal edits.
